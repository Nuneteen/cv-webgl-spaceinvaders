# cv-webgl-spaceinvaders
Space invaders game made in WebGL for Computer Graphics course.

To do list:
- game performance super slow (gotta make a vertice vector with all vertices from all models)
- get a way to detect colision when bullet hits invader (position vectors)
- delete invader (get position and ???)
- next level (all invaders dead + increase invader speed + restart level)
- game over (invaders gets down)

Bonus stuff:
- pause game
- different colors for different invaders
